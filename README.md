   I decided to create something based on space invaders, this was it.
   
   This was my first javascript program, an assignment for my class in
   spring of 2019. I had no prior javascript knowledge or use, however
   the assignment called for us to create anything that we wanted to
   as long as we met the 1 week deadline. I decided on space invaders!
   
   The framework for this code was partially constructed by using the
   online block editing program by Microsoft, MakeCode for Microbit.
