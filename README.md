   I decided to create something based on space invaders, this was it.
   
   Creation process: I googled space invaders microbit, and found this
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDaIOIpY38A @ IntenseComputerTrain
   Who wanted to create a new game simmilar to space invaders but had
   deviated from the design of it to create his own thing. This was an
   attempt to create a kind of shooter game based on space invaders.
   I followed along and borrowed the movement concept and started work
   inside of the same block editor program from microsoft.
   
   I decided to deviate from his design in how bullets are removed and
   decided to approach the game in a more classical way by using the
   movement concept at the end of a few loops apply to the y value in
   the same light as the original space invaders. I also borrowed the
   concept of the bullets firing, but I figured out how hits worked.

   From that point on I closed the video and played around with it, 
   as well as the actual code without any additional references.
   It was pure exploratory shannanigans from that point forward!

   Once I had the general game down, I decided I needed to create some
   cool lazer sounds and hits, so I played around with time scales and
   settled on some noises I think worked out well. I tried to make the
   sounds for the enemy as well and explosions, but I ran into some
   issues with the built-in gameover function where it would loop the
   sound forever, even if I put in pauses or tried to kill the sounds.
   
   This was pretty fun, and I am looking forward to getting some of my
   team mates to play the game and try it out tomorrow during class!
